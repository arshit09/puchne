## 🔧 Technical Overview

Puchne handles the complexities of modern web apps (React/Vue/ProseMirror) by intelligently simulating user input:

- **Bypassing Virtual DOMs:** Uses native prototype hooks to ensure state updates trigger in AI textareas.
- **Event Simulation:** Replicates `InputEvent` and `DataTransfer` to work with advanced editors like ProseMirror (Claude/ChatGPT).
- **Tab Synchronization:** Background workers ensure prompts are only injected once the page is fully ready.
